This is how you build ISP by suppressing the ample-set fix. 
This step is essential now because ISP's ample-set optimization
is broken and seg-faults on some examples, esp. the heat-flow
example in our SC'11 demo!

Note that the "isp -a" flag need not be set, as main.cpp inside
scheduler now has   bool no_ample_set_fix = true; 

1) ./configure --enable-optional-ample-set-fix

2) make

3) make install
