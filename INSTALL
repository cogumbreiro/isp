If you are building/installing ISP from a tarball, you
only need to perform the following:

./configure --prefix="Some Directory"
make
make install

Otherwise, if you're building from a repository checkout,
  please perform these steps:

autoreconf --force
./configure --prefix="Some Directory"
make
make install
